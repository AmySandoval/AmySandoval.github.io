I'm an economics student at Texas A&M University. I will be graduating with my bachelors of Science in Economics December 2019. I am looking for opprotunities in data science and economic development.

I am currently a printer bench technician specialist at the software company Reynolds and Reynolds. From my employment here, I have gain effectiveness qualities for optimal team working and time management.
