**Abstract**

This paper will explore the impact of business owners’ gender and their gender-owned business type on their business’ annual payroll. It will estimate this impact through an OLS regression controlling for both owners’ characteristics and their businesses’ characteristics using the public use microdata sample (PUMS) data from the 2007 Survey of Business Owners and Self-Employed Persons (SBO). The results, when tested independently, demonstrate that the estimates of 𝛽1 and 𝛽2 are statistically far from 0 at the 1% level. The results also demonstrate a statistically significant affect on annual payroll when businesses are equally male/female-owned and male-owned. This paper also encourages others to further examine gender differences in entrepreneurship.
